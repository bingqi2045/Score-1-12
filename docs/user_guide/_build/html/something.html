<h2>Types of Users and Their Rights<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-users-and-their-rights" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Score has two user roles, namely, End User and OAGIS Developer (or
Developer for short). There is also the Admin right that can be assigned
to either an End User or a Developer. The Admin right provides access to
the “Admin” menu that allows to Create a User, Update User’s Information
(including password reset), and Enable or Disable User Account. The
Developer role has access to all functions except for <a class="reference external" href="#extend-a-bie">Extend a
BIE</a>. The End User role has access to all functions.
When a user logins into Score, a message is displayed to inform the user
whether the account has the End User or the Developer role. Moreover,
the role is shown next to the user account name at the top-right of the
page.</p>
<p>It is important that developer roles be used only for developing
standards particularly the Core Components (CCs). Standard Development
Organizations (SDOs) may wish to also standardize BIEs, in which case
the developer role should be used to manage those BIEs as well. For
detailed differences between developer and end user CCs or BIEs, it is
important to read <a class="reference external" href="#developer-vs-end-user-core-components">Developer Vs. end user core
components</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="#standard-developer-core-component-management">Standard/Developer Core Component
Management</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="#end-user-core-component-management">End
user core component management</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="#bie-management">BIE Management</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, BIE content cannot be used or reused across developer and end
user role. And developer CCs cannot use end user CCs, but end user CCs
can use developer CCs. This is naturally the case as developer CCs are
standard and should not contain non-standard content created by the end
user. However, the end user CCs should be able to use standard CCs,
create by the developer.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes in details user rights to different kinds of
entities. Availability of certain actions also depends on the entity
state. The detail in the Other Dev and Other End Users columns should be
read in the context of the Dev. Owner and End User Owner columns,
respectively, i.e., it is the rights to the entity they do not currently
own.</p>
<p>‘Transfer’ means transfer of ownership. It is important to note that
transfers can occur only between the same user role.</p>
<p>In the table, CRUD = Create/Read/Update/Delete; CRUDE = CRUD and Extend;
CURD = Create/Update/Read/Discard, CURDE = CURD and Extend. Delete is
different from Discard in that Delete is only marked as deleted and can
be restored. Discard is permanently purged from the database and cannot
be restored.</p>
<p>Changing the role of a user (i.e., from end user to developer and vice
versa) is not allowed since it will impact how the Score behaves on the
existing content that the user might have already created.</p>
<p>Table summarizing user rights for different entities – CRUD =
Create/Read/Update/Delete; CRUDE = CRUD, Extend; CURD =
Create/Update/Read/Discard, CURDE = CURD, Extend. “Everything but
Update, Delete, and Transfer” means “Everything that the Dev. Owner can
do (according to the cell to left) but Update, Delete, and Transfer)”</p>

top-level BIEs but never enabled in any top-level BIEs. Those
additions to the extension are indicated in the last “Association
Property Term” column. The query looks across all BIEs in the
repository. For example, a user invokes an extension to the
Application Area component in a Process BOM top-level BIE. He adds
BCCP1 and BCCP2 to the Application Area Extension. If there are two
top-level BIEs in the database that has Application Area in the BIE
tree, e.g., the Process BOM one and a Process Purchase Order one, and
only BCCP1 is enabled in the Process BOM while the Process Purchase
Order has initialized the Application Area Extension node but does
not have anything underneath enabled; there will be two entries in
this table. One entry is for the BCCP2 in the Process BOM and another
for the BCCP2 in the Process Purchase Order, since BCCP2 is never
enabled in either of the two top-level BIEs. If there is the third
top-level BIE containing the Application Area, however, the user has
never initialized the Application Area extension node; the table will
still have only two entries. This is because BBIEP2 is never
initialized in the database via that third top-level BIE. Specific
BIE nodes are initialized only if the user has expanded the parent
tree node of those BIEs.</p></li>

<h2>Core Component in Brief<a class="headerlink" href="#core-component-in-brief" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Core Components or CCs for short are canonical, context-independent data
(exchange) models. The meta-model of CCs in Score follows the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/codesfortrade/CCTS/CCTS-Version3.pdf">UN/CEFACT
Core Component Specification (CCS)
standard</a>,
also known as ISO 15000-5.</p>
<p>Score treats CCs as the canonical model of a data exchange standard such
as the Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) or
MIMOSA CCOM. In CCS, Business Information Entities (or BIEs) can be
derived from CCs. Score treats BIEs like an implementation/usage guide
of corresponding CCs for a particular business context. See the <a class="reference external" href="#end-user-core-component-management">BIE
Management</a> section for further
explanation about BIEs.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, there are 7 types of CCs you should know about for using
Score. They are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Aggregate Core Component (ACC)</p></li>
<li><p>Association Core Component Property (ASCCP)</p></li>
<li><p>Association Core Component (ASCC)</p></li>

<li><p>Business Data Type (BDT)</p></li>
<li><p>Code List (CL)</p></li>
<li><p>Agency Identifier List</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Explanations about these types of CCs including Score specific
implementation details are given next and the figure below shows the
example used throughout the explanation.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/image1.png"><img alt="_images/image1.png" src="_images/image1.png" style="width: 5.95885in; height: 3.21695in;" /></a>
<section id="aggregate-core-component-acc">
<h3>Aggregate Core Component (ACC)<a class="headerlink" href="#aggregate-core-component-acc" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACC represents reusable complex data structure, i.e., one that has one
or more properties, some of which are also complex data structures. Some
ACCs are semantic data structure, some are architectural archetype. An
example of an ACC is “Purchase Order”, which may have “Identifier”,
“Order Date Time”, “Customer Party”, and “Purchase Order Line”
properties. While “Identifier” and “Order Date Time” are simple
properties, “Customer Party” and “Purchase Order Line” are complex
properties and are represented by another ACC. Hence, ACCs can be
building blocks for other complex data structures.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use ACC as a building block, 1) as a based type
inheritance for another ACC and 2) as a representation of a property.</p>
<p>In the first case, an “Order” ACC, which has “Identifier” and “Order
Date Time” properties, may be a based type of the “Purchase Order” ACC.
That means, the “Purchase Order” ACC inherits these two properties from
the based “Order” ACC. While the ACCs’ based type relationship is not
supported in CCS, Score extends the CCS model to support that.</p>
<p>As stated earlier some ACCs are semantic data structures and some are
architecture archetypes. Taking OAGIS as an example, it has an
architectural archetype called “Base” to support its extension
architecture. For instance, OAGIS standard defines “Address Base” and
“Address” ACCs for the “Address” semantic entity; all semantic
properties are placed in the “Address Base” ACC while the “Address” ACC
is based on the “Address Base” ACC and only adds to it an extension
point. Score Core Component Management has specific features to address
OAGIS architectural requirements and also XML schema features. These
will be described in specific sections about the management of these
different types of CCs.</p>
<p>In the second case of ACC as building block, “Party” and “Purchase Order
Line” ACCs may be used as the representations for the “Customer” and the
“Purchase Order Line” properties. To use an ACC as a representation of a
property, an ASCCP that is described next has to be first created and
then association, ASCC, from the “Purchase Order” to the ASCCP then can
be made. These are described next.</p>
</section>
<section id="association-core-component-property-asccp">
<h3>Association Core Component Property (ASCCP)<a class="headerlink" href="#association-core-component-property-asccp" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Practically, ASCCP allows ACC to be reused as a property of another ACC.
All CCS entities have an important detail called Dictionary Entry Name
(DEN). While ACC DEN is made up of an Object Class Term and the fixed
string “Details” such as “Purchase Order. Details” – “Purchase Order” is
the Object Class Term; an ASCCP DEN is made up of its unique Property
Term and the ACC’s Object Class Term representing its data structure
(notice that each term in DEN is separated by a dot and a space and each
word is separated by a space). Oftentimes, the Property Term is the same
as Object Class Term such that an ASCCP DEN looks like “Party. Party”
because a Party ASCCP is also represented by the Party ACC; however,
this is not always the case. For example, a Property Term may be
“Customer Party” which may also be represented by the “Party. Details”
ACC. In this case, according to the CCS truncation rule, DEN of the
ASCCP would be “Customer. Party”. However, Score has NOT implemented the
truncation rule; therefore, DEN is “Customer Party. Party” in Score.</p>
<p>Property Term is the most important detail of the ASCCP. If you would
like to understand the detail to why Score has not implemented the
truncation rule in DEN, read on; otherwise, you can skip to the next
section that describes ASCC. ASCC is the way in which an ACC uses an
ASCCP.</p>
<p>There are three reasons to why Score has not implemented the truncation
rule in DEN. First, Score was initially tested on an existing standard.
While the standard also adopted CCS, its normative form was in XML
schema. Therefore, Score has to reverse engineered the standard from XML
schema into the CCS meta-model. Due to limited development resources,
the reverse engineering has to be done by code. Names in the XML schema
may be resulting from the truncation rule; and in such case, it is not
computationally deterministic to recognize what the full Property Term
is. Taking the component named “Bank Draft Check” that should be
imported into Score as an ASCCP. It uses the component named “Check”
that should be imported into Score as an ACC. It is not clear whether
the Property Term should be just “Bank Draft” or “Bank Draft Check”.</p>
<p>The second reason follows the first reason that Score cannot rely on DEN
to express the CCs into XML schemas such that the generated schemas are
the same as the imported source. It is more reliable to use the whole
component name as the Property Term and then use the Property Term to
generate schemas as well.</p>
<p>The third reason, as it turned out, when reading the untruncated DEN, it
is clearer what the Property Term is and searching is simpler as well.
For example, if the user thinks about searching for the “Bank Draft
Check” notion. He does not have to worry about putting “Bank Draft.
Check” or “Bank Draft Check” in the search field; he can just type in
the DEN search field, “Bank Draft Check”.</p>
<p>DEN is a generated field in Score. At some point in the future, the
algorithm for DEN can change to use the truncation rule, if the user
community wants so.</p>
</section>
<section id="association-core-component-ascc">
<h3>Association Core Component (ASCC)<a class="headerlink" href="#association-core-component-ascc" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an ACC has an ASCCP as a property, there is an association from the
ACC to the ASCCP. An ASCC represents that association. An ASCC has a DEN
which is composed of the Object Class Term of the ACC and the DEN of the
ASCCP.</p>
<p>For example, the “Purchase Order. Details” ACC has the property
“Customer Party. Party” ASCCP means that there is a “Purchase Order.
Customer Party. Party” ASCC representing the association between the ACC
and the ASCCP. The ASCC carries details such as the cardinality of the
property, the definition of the property when used under the ACC.</p>
<p>In Score, ASCC is local to the ACC. It is not reused.</p>
</section>
<section id="basic-core-component-property-bccp">
<h3>Basic Core Component Property (BCCP)<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-core-component-property-bccp" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just like ASCCP, BCCP is a reusable property that can be used by an ACC.
The difference is BCCP has a simpler structure or no structure. BCCP
itself can carry a value (in an instance data) and can have at most one
level of children. An example of a BCCP is “Tax Amount”; and it has a
child “Currency Code”. An instance data of the “Tax Amount” BCCP
includes the 3000 value of the tax amount itself and the “US Dollar”
value of the “Currency Code”.</p>
<p>Just like ASCCP, BCCP also has a Property Term representing its
semantics. DEN of the BCCP is made up of the Property Term and the Data
Type Term of the BDT it uses. BDT will be described below, but BDT
indicates the values and the children the BCCP can have. For example,
the “Tax Amount” BCCP uses the “Amount. Type” BDT. Since Property Term
of the BCCP is “Tax Amount” and Data Type Term of the BDT is “Amount”,
the BCCP DEN is “Tax Amount. Amount” if the truncation rule is not used
(See the ASCCP section about why Score does not use the CCS DEN
truncation rule). Basic Core Component (BCC)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the name, BCC, is not very suggestive of what it is. But
it might be easier to remember BCC as a counterpart of the ASCC. That
is, think of it as an association from the ACC to the BCCP (just like
ASCC as an association from ACC to the ASCCP). Similar to the ASCC, BCC
has DEN which is made up of the ACC’s Object Class Term and the BCCP
DEN. For example, the “Order. Details” ACC has the property Identifier
means that it uses the “Identifier. Identifier” BCCP. Consequently, DEN
of the respective BCC is “Order. Identifier. Identifier”.</p>
</section>
<section id="business-data-type-bdt">
<h3>Business Data Type (BDT)<a class="headerlink" href="#business-data-type-bdt" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>BDT is a standard data type defined based on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/codesfortrade/CCTS/CCTS-DTCatalogueVersion3p1.pdf">Core Data Type
Catalog</a>,
a companion specification to the CCS. Practically, BDT is used to
indicate values (or formally, a value domain) a simple property can
take, and the child attributes it can have and their value domains. For
example, the “Amount. Type” BDT is defined to have the decimal value
domain, one attribute whose DEN is “Amount. Currency. Code”, and the
value domain of the currency code is an ISO standard code list.
Attribute of a BDT is called Supplementary Component (SC) in CCS and the
part of the BDT that holds the BDT’s value is called Content Component.
Both Content Component and Supplementary Component may have multiple
value domains, one of which is a default.</p>
<p>The first part of the BDT DEN such as “Amount. Type” is called Data Type
Term. Data Type Term is used to make up the second part of the BCCP DEN
as in “Tax Amount. Amount”. BDT DEN may include a qualifier in front of
the Data Type Term separated by the under bar such as “Open_ Amount.
Type”. The qualifier communicates additional semantics and may also
results in a restriction to the value domain.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Reading about how CDT, BDT, and BIE work in Score</strong>:
According to CCS, BDT is derived from its Core Data Type (CDT)
counterpart and CCs are supposed to use only CDT and BIEs use only BDT.
Since BDT can be exactly the same as CDT, Score simplifies the user
experience and expose only BDTs even though the underlying repository
has the BDT and CDT relationships. Additionally, standards which are
treated as CCs in Score already supply and use BDT; and hence, Score
allows CCs to use BDTs. On the BIE side, Score does not expose BDT
separately for simpler user experience; consequently, value domains and
SCs also appear as they are applied directly to BBIEs.</p>
<section id="types-of-bdts-in-score">
<h4>Types of BDTs in Score<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-bdts-in-score" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>BDTs in Score are classified into default BDT, unqualified BDT, and
qualified BDT.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Default BDTs are variation of OAGIS implementations of CDTs. These
BDTs use various primitives for the content and supplementary
components. They don’t have semantic qualifiers. OAGIS suffixes the
data type term of the based CDT with random string.</p></li>
<li><p>An unqualified BDTs can be viewed as an OAGIS selection of default
BDTs for a particular CDT. Therefore, unqualified BDTs do not have a
semantic qualifier. For example, for the “Amount CDT”, OAGIS selects
“AmountType_0723C8” default BDT, which uses double as primitive for
the content component and token for its “Currency Code” SC.
Consequently, OAGIS define an “AmountType” BDT based on the
“AmountType_0723C8”. These are good BDTs to use with BCCPs because
they use the least restrictive primitives that can be further
restricted in the BIE. It follows that all OAGIS BCCPs use
unqualified BDTs and qualified BDTs but not any other default BDTs</p></li>
<li><p>Qualified BDTs are BDTs with a semantic qualifier. A lot of qualified
BDTs are created so that code list can be used with BCCPs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Score also employs another flag called Commonly Used. This flag is
generally for convenient. In the OAGIS data shipped with Score, BDTs
used by BCCPs in OAGIS 10.6 are flagged with Commonly Used equal true.</p>

<p>Code List is a list of allowable values (however, sometimes standards
intentionally leave the list open to any additional values for
extensibility reason).</p>
<p>While CCS meta-model does not regard CL as a kind of CCs, Score treats
CLs defined as part of the canonical standard as CC to facilitate the
standard publication and usage purpose.</p>
<p>The Core Data Type Catalog specification specifies “Identifier Scheme”
as another way of providing a value domain to the BDT and its SC. Score
has not implemented “Identifier Scheme” management in full blown. It
allows management of one kind of “Identifier Scheme” which is the
“Agency Identifier” and the implementation is specifically a list of
values</p>

<h2>Key Concepts of Score CC Management<a class="headerlink" href="#key-concepts-of-score-cc-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to employing the CCS meta-model, Score aims to improve the
state of art in <strong>collaborative</strong> development of a standard data model
with enhanced <strong>traceability</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to being a web-based application that allows multiple users
to simultaneously access a single source of truth, life cycle states
each CC have also contributed to enhancing the collaborative experience
in Score. CCs can take various states. These states allow for the CC
developers to let their collaborators know the readiness of the CCs to
be reviewed or put into a release. CCs can be viewed and used by others
even while it is still being developed. A mechanism was designed so that
references between CCs cannot become invalid. That is deleted CCs can be
restored by another user. More details about CC life-cycle states are
described in the <a class="reference external" href="#developer-vs-end-user-core-components">Developer Vs. end user core
components</a> section and
other specific CC management sections.</p>
<p>Score also supports the release concept, just like the traditional way
of publishing a standard or software. At present, a single Score
database intends to support only backwardly compatible releases. It
should be noted that backward compatibility depends on syntactical
expression of the CCs. Therefore, Score backward compatibility may be
more liberal than that of a specific syntax expected by a particular
standard user. Release also has states that support typical standard
publication and review process. This is further described in the
<a class="reference external" href="#release-management">Release Management</a> section.</p>
<p>Once CCs are published/released, they can be revised. Score keeps
revisions of CCs for each of its release (as part of the whole
standard). For traceability enhancement, every change to CCs is also
kept in Score database. These are called history.</p>
<p>Releases of a standard are kept in the Score database (as delta). The
user can work with multiple backwardly compatible releases in the tool.
For example, some ongoing integration projects may still use CC
definitions from an older release, while new integration projects can
embark on CC definitions from the latest release</p>
<section id="cc-ownership">
<h3>CC ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#cc-ownership" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The user who creates the CC is the first owner of the CC. Ownership of
the CC can be transferred only between the same types of users –
developer user or end user.</p>
<p>There are three situations when the ownership of a CC is automatically
transferred. First is when a user <em>restores</em> a deleted CC. Second is
when the developer user <em>revises</em> the CC, and lastly when the end user
<em>amends</em> the CC. In those cases, the ownership is automatically
transferred to the user who performed the respective actions. See also
the <a class="reference external" href="#cc-states">cc</a> section.</p>
<p>CC details are always visible to other users (in any state). It is just
that only the owner can make changes to the CC. The only exception is
when CCs are put into a release. Any developer can put any CC in the
<a class="reference external" href="#cc-states">Candidate state</a> into a release and then manage their
release states.</p>
</section>
<section id="developer-vs-end-user-core-components">
<h3>Developer Vs. end user core components<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-vs-end-user-core-components" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Core components (CCs) can be created and managed by either Score
developer user or end user. The intention for CCs created by the
developer is for them to become a standard. The intention for CCs
created by the end user are for used in the BIE extension. BIE extension
is typically used when there is an urgent need to add to the standard or
when there is unique requirement to add to the standard to meet the
integration need, see the <a class="reference external" href="#extend-a-bie">Extend a BIE</a> section.</p>
<p>CCs created by the Score developer role are called <em>Developer CCs</em>
(DCCs) or <em>Standard CCs</em>. CCs created by Score end user role are called
<em>End User CCs</em> (EUCCs).</p>
<p>The most important difference between DCCs and EUCCs is their life
cycles. The way EUCCs interact with BIEs is also different, but this
will be explained in the <a class="reference external" href="#extend-a-bie">Extend a BIE</a> section. The
next section below describes CC states.</p>
</section>
<section id="cc-states">
<h3>CC states<a class="headerlink" href="#cc-states" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<section id="developer-cc-states">
<h4>Developer CC states<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-cc-states" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The figure below shows life cycle states of DCCs. When a CC is created
for the first time, it has a WIP state with revision number 1. The
creator is the owner. If a developer revises a Published CC, it also has
a WIP state with an incremental revision number and has a new owner.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/image2.jpg"><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="_images/image2.jpg" style="width: 6.5in; height: 2.20833in;" /></a>
<p>All users (not just developers) have read access to CCs in all states.
Only the current owner has the write access when a CC is in the WIP
state. The ownership of a CC is relinquished when the CC is in the
Deleted or Published state. In other words, another developer can take
over the ownership by restoring a deleted CC or revising a published CC.
Transitions from Candidate to Release Draft and from Release Draft to
Published of a CC is occurred by the state transitions of the Release,
to which the CC is assigned. See more about this in the <a class="reference external" href="#release-management">Release
Management</a> section. The table below summarizes
the action and authorization in each state.</p>

<p>The intention of the Draft, Candidate, and Deleted states is to help
with the development collaborations where multiple developers may work
on different parts of the release changes and uses each other’s CCs.</p>
<p>The Deleted state in particular ensures that references across CCs do
not become invalid if the owner does not want that CC anymore. If a CC
is deleted (accept BCC and ASCC), it can be restored by any other
developer.</p>
<p>The Draft and Candidate states along with the Release Draft and
Published state are for development collaboration. Exactly how these
states are used may subject to a practice designed by a specific
standard governing body. The following is an example, a CC developer
transitions a set of related CCs to the Draft state to indicate that
they are ready to be reviewed. That set of CCs and others advanced to
the Draft state are reviewed and received comments by a group of CC
developers. Some that need changes are put back to WIP state, changed,
and put back to Draft again for the next review cycle; some that need no
further changes are moved to Candidate. CCs may be cycled through WIP
and Draft a few times. In addition, CCs in the Candidate state may need
to be moved back to WIP for some changes due to dependencies to other
CCs. Next the group of developers (e.g., the standard architecture
committee) decides that a set of Candidate CCs is sufficient to make a
release, a developer (e.g., the chief architect) create a release draft
from those Candidate CCs. The release draft may be opened to public
reviews and comments. At this state, CCs in the release draft cannot be
changed by anyone. If changes are needed, the whole release draft is
cancelled and all CCs in it are transitioned back to the Candidate
state, at which point further changes can be made. If no changes are
needed, a developer can move the Release into the Published state and
all CCs in the release draft are also moved correspondingly. Using these
states with issue management system, such as GitHub Issue or Jira, an
SDO can establish an agile standard development process.</p>

<section id="end-user-cc-states">
<h4>End user CC states<a class="headerlink" href="#end-user-cc-states" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Next, the state diagram below shows the life cycle of EUCCs. EUCCs can
have four states. When an EUCC is first created, it has the WIP state.
An EUCC is always created and living in a specific release. When an EUCC
uses DCCs, those DCCs have to be in the same release and DCCs’
specifications are with respect to the release.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/image3.jpg"><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="_images/image3.jpg" style="width: 5.77083in; height: 2.21875in;" /></a>
<p>WIP state means that the CC is still being changed or in fluid
condition. QA generally means that the CC is ready to be reviewed or
tested. Finally, Production means that the CC is already in used in a
deployment.</p>
<p>All users (not just end users) have read access to EUCCs. Only the
current owner has write access when an EUCC is in the WIP state. The
ownership of an EUCC is relinquished when the CC is in the Deleted or
Production state. In other words, another end user can take over the
ownership by restoring a deleted CC or amending a production EUCC. The
table below summarizes the action and authorization in each state.</p>

<p>The intention of the QA, Production, and Deleted states is to help with
the development collaborations where multiple end users may work on
different parts of the release changes.</p>
<p>The Deleted state allows the CCs to be managed independently while still
encouraging collaboration and reuses. Even though a user may no longer
want a CC, another user may still use the CC. The user who owned and
deleted the CC can document the reason he/she deleted and what CC may
have replaced it. Other users who have CCs depending on that CC can
determine whether to continue using that CC or switch to a replacement
CC. If a user decides to continue using it, he/she can restore the CC
back to the WIP state again.</p>
<p>The QA and Production states allow the end user community to manage EUCC
development collaboratively and along with integration project
development life cycle. Exactly how these two states are used may
subject to a practice designed by a specific end user community.</p>
<p>Since Score 2.0, the flexibility between the EUCC life cycle and the BIE
life cycle was provided, while also minimizing the performance impact.
That is EUCCs can be modified even when there is active (non-Production)
BIEs relying on them, albeit with some limitations. That is, when the
EUCC is not in the Production state, it cannot be profiled in BIE. In
other words, the EUCC is also locked in BIE during its amendment until
it is in the Production state again. In addition, only backwardly
compatible changes can be made during the amendment. Further details
about EUCC and BIE interactions are described in the <a class="reference external" href="#extend-a-bie">Extend a
BIE</a> section.</p>

<p>Score treats ACC, ASCCP, BCCP, BDT, Code List, and Agency Identifier
List as separate unit of controls. In other words, their states are
independently managed; and the following entities and their states are
managed as part of one of those unit of controls. 1) BCCs and ASCCs are
part of an ACC unit of control. 2) SCs is part of a BDT unit of control.

<p>Component types are Score feature that supports OAGIS standard
architecture. It only applies to ACC.</p>
<p>While there are eight component types, Score users usually use only 2
that are <em>Base</em> and <em>Semantics</em>. They may seldomly use another one,
which is <em>Semantic Group</em>. They will also frequently see <em>Extension</em> and

<p>Searching for a Core Component is performed in the “Core Component”

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>On the top menu of the page, click “Core Component”.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose “View/Edit Core Component” from the drop-down list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The “Core Component” page is returned where ACC, ASCC, ASCCP, BCC, BCCP,
CDT (Core Data Type), and BDT (Business Data Type) are displayed
according to filters in the bottom table. You can use the filters
described and depicted on the screenshot below to filter the list of CCs
that is displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Branch</em> allows for filtering the Core Components based on their
release. To do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Choose the release you would like to view from the “Branch”
drop-down list near the top-left of the page. Specifically,
“Working” means the release being worked on, based on the latest
release. In other words, if the current latest release is
“10.6”, “Working” means 10.6 plus changes; and if “10.6” or
“10.5” is selected then only core components <strong>and their
details</strong> as they were at the release will be displayed. All
releases are generally incremental. See also
<a class="reference external" href="#branch">Branch</a>.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Note:</strong> Any change in the <em>Branch</em> filter of a CC-related page
(i.e., the “Code List” and “Core Component” page) is stored and
used across all CC-related pages. The “Code List” page is
considered CC-related when it is visited via “View/Edit Code
List” under the “Core Component” menu. However, it is considered
BIE-related when it is visited via “View/Edit Code List” under
the “BIE” menu.</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Type</em> allows for filtering the results based on the <a class="reference external" href="#core-component-in-brief">CC

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Click on it and check or uncheck the “ACC”, “ASCC”, “ASCCP”,
“BCC”, “BCCP”, “CDT”, or “BDT” checkboxes to filter out various
CC types. If no CC type is selected, the filter is not used.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>State</em> allows for filtering the results based on Core Components’
state. To use this filter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Click on it and check the checkboxes to list core components in
those states. If no State is selected, the filter is not used. For
definitions of states, see the <a class="reference external" href="#cc-states">CC States</a> section.
See also the <a class="reference external" href="#cc-unit-of-control">CC unit of control</a> section.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Deprecated</em> allows for filtering in or out deprecated CCs. Select
“True” to show only deprecated CCs or “False” to show only CCs that
are not deprecated. Both are included when neither option is
selected.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Component Type</em> enables filtering ACC based on the <a class="reference external" href="#component-types">Component
Type</a> that supports OAGIS architecture. To use
this filter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check the desired checkboxes next to the <a class="reference external" href="#component-types">Component
Type</a>. If no selection is performed, the
filter is not used. Note that Component Type only applies to ACC.
If no (CC) Type filtering is selected, all types of CCs are still
listed. In other words, if the Component Type filter is used, it
might be better to set the Type filter to only ACC.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Free form text filtering based on CCs’ <em>DEN</em> (dictionary entry name),
<em>Definition</em>, <em>Module</em> or a combination of them. The matching is case
insensitive. To use these filters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enter a search string in the <em>DEN</em> (the name of the core
component), <em>Definition</em> or <em>Module</em> field and click “Search”
button. Note that search strings entered in three fields are
treated as having an AND logical relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to note that the DEN is stored in space-separated
format (while the XML schema or other expressions of the standard
may have the name formatted in camel case). For example, type in
“Employee Count” instead of “EmployeeCount”. In addition, “ID” is
stored as “Identifier” in DEN.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Definition</em> field allows you to find a core component whose
definition matches the input string. The content in the Definition
is generally written in normal language grammar. Keep in mind
though that if you try to match a data element name in the
Definition, it may still be in the camel case format. The tool
does not parse the Definition when it is imported. Unfortunately,
when standard developers refer to data elements in the definition
there is no consistent convention. For example, one definition may
be “Address of the Customer Party” while another may be “Business
Unit of the CustomerParty”. Notice that the format of the
“Customer Party” data element is inconsistent in the two
definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>A good technique is to search with longer input string first, if
nothing found try changing to different synonyms, and also try
shortening the input string where more results, yet less accurate,
will be returned.</p></li>
<li><p>Use double quotes around the search terms in <em>DEN</em> and
<em>Definition</em>, to match the exact substring as in the double
quotes. For example, if search input in the <em>DEN</em> field is “”Name
Identification””, part of the DEN has to match the whole search
input. In other words, a component with DEN “Named Identification.
Details” won’t be returned. However, if the search input in the
<em>DEN</em> field is “Name Identification” without double quotes, DENs
that partially match both tokens will be returned. In other words,
the CC with DEN “Named Identification. Details” will be returned.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Module</em> field allows for filtering based on the physical file
path the core component resides based on the Module Assignment in
Score. The path is stored with a backslash and without the file

example, all shared components reside in subfolders of the
“Model\Platform\2_4\Common” folder, nouns are serialized to the
respective noun module (e.g. “Model\Nouns\PurchaseOrder”). To
search only shared components, the user may enter “common” in the

“nouns” in the <em>Module</em> field.</p></li>

<h3>How to Read a Core Component<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-read-a-core-component" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>After searching for a Core Component (see <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-search-and-filter-for-a-core-component">How to Search and Filter for
a Core Component</a>),
you can view its details by clicking its DEN (DEN column). Clicking
anywhere else in the row and the row will be expanded to show the
definition of the CC.</p>
<p>Doing so, a page is returned having the name of the CC you have chosen.
This page is divided into the two panes; the left one depicting the
structure of the CC in the form of a tree and the right one showing the
fields of a selected CC in the tree.</p>
<p>The CC tree is a data structure in which different types of components
are organized through the tree hierarchy. The table and figure below
provide a quick reference to what these types of CCs are. The following
five (5) formats are used to distinguish different types of components
in the tree:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Bold Red font</strong> is for an ACC. Another way to recognize an ACC in
the tree is it is displayed with its DEN, which ends with “.
Details”. When there is an ACC node directly under another ACC node,
the node on the top is based on (i.e., extends) the bottom ACC and
inherits all properties from the bottom (based) ACC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bold Blue font</strong> is for ASCCs along with ASCCPs they use. This node
displays the property term of the ASCCP.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Italic Grey font</em> is for BCCs along with BCCPs and BDTs they use.
These BCCs have been designated as attributes (as in XML Schema, it
should be noted that this attribute designation is needed so that
Score can maintain backward compatibility with some standards that
have their normative form in XML Schema). The node displays the
property term of the BCCP.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular green font is for BBCs along with BCCPs and BDTs they use.
This node displays the property term of the BCCP.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular red font is for Supplementary Components (SC).</p></li>

<h3>Search within a Core Component Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#search-within-a-core-component-tree" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>On an opened “Core Component” detail page, the user can search for any
descendant nodes, which can be various types of CC entities. To do this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Click in the tree, on the node to be used as search scope. Only nodes
under the selected node will be used as the search space.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the search term above the tree pane.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the search (magnifying glass) button. Some CCs are very big
containing tens of thousands of nodes and search can take a few
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the “Exclude SCs” checkbox in order to skip (i.e., exclude) the
SC nodes from the searching function. When it is checked (i.e.,
enabled) the searching function does not consider the SC nodes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: There is a search option next to the search button. For faster
search, supplementary components of the CCs, which repeat a lot, are
excluded by default. The user can switch off this exclusion, but the
search will be slower.</p>

one node. <strong>Work Order Header</strong> is an ASCC and ASCCP bundled into one
node. Under the <strong>Work Order Header</strong> of the <strong>Work Order. Details</strong>,
the tree shows that its ASCCP was created from the <strong>Work Order Header.
Details</strong> ACC. The hierarchy of ACCs directly under the <strong>Work Order

<strong>Work Order Header. Details</strong> extends <strong>Work Order Header Base.
Details</strong>, which in turn extends another hierarchy of extensions from

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: How to find where a BCCP is used. BCC DEN pattern can help
locate the ACCs that use a particular BCCP. Make sure that the BCC is
checked or better yet the only one checked on the <em>Type</em> filter. In the
<em>DEN</em> field, input a search string like this “. [BCCP DEN]”. For
example, we can see where the “Street Name” BCCP whose DEN is “Street
Name. Name” is used by input “. Street Name. Name” in the <em>DEN</em> field.
Note that the double quotes should be included in the <em>Search</em> field for
a more precise match. Note also that BCC has no detail page, so clicking
on the BCC search result does not do anything. To see the detail of the
particular ACC, copy the first token of the ASCC DEN, which is the
object class term of an ACC and use it as a search input (make sure that
ACC is selected in the Type filter).</p>

<li><p><em>Reusable</em>. This flag supports the notion of local element
expression in XML Schema. It is required but it is defaulted to
true, which makes the ASCCP analogous to the global element in XML
Schema. There are two consequences when an ASCCP is set to not
reusable – 1) the application will allow only one ASCC to use the
ASCCP; and 2) there can be multiple ASCCPs with the same property
term in a single release. In OAGIS, the Data Area component in a

point is needed. For example, “Personnel Base. Details” is based on
“Employee Base. Details”, which in turn is based on “Person Base.
Details”. See also <a class="reference external" href="#create-oagis-extension-point-for-an-acc">Create OAGIS Extension point for an

<h4>Create OAGIS Extension point for an ACC<a class="headerlink" href="#create-oagis-extension-point-for-an-acc" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is a feature specific to OAGIS design pattern. Each OAGIS component
typically has an extension point. The OAGIS extension design pattern is
as follows. First, create an ACC whose <em>Component Type</em> is set to
<em>Base</em>; its object class term should end with “Base”, e.g., “Party
Base”. This is the ACC where all properties reside. Then, create another
ACC whose <em>Component Type</em> is set to <em>Semantics</em> and it is based on the
first ACC. The object class term of this ACC should be the same as that
of the first ACC but without the word “Base”, e.g., “Party”. For OAGIS,
the Semantics ACC is where the extension point should be created. Score
provides a macro to do that. Necessary entities are created with correct
names and properties. To do that.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Make sure the <a class="reference external" href="#view-detail-of-an-acc">ACC detail page is open</a>,
it is in the WIP state, and is owned by the current user. ACC must
not already have a property named “Extension”.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the ellipsis next to the root node of the ACC and select
“Create OAGi Extension Component”. This menu item is not visible if
the ACC already has a property named “Extension”.</p></li>
<li><p>A dialog appears asking for confirmation or cancellation.</p></li>
<li><p>If confirmed, the ACC will be inserted with the “Extension” property
at the bottom. It should be noted that if the user removes the
property and invoke this macro again, it will result in duplication
extension components created. The user can simply add the existing
property extension ASCCP instead of invoking the macro. For OAGIS,
the proper extension ASCCP for an ACC is the one with this DEN
pattern “Extension. [Object Class Term] Extension”. For example, for
“Party. Details” ACC, a proper extension ASCCP is “Extension. Party
Extension”. If duplicated extension CCs were created, the user should
<a class="reference external" href="#delete-a-newly-created-cc">delete</a> them. The extraneous
components would include the extension ASCCP and ACC with DENs such
as “Extension. Party Extension” and “Party Extension. Details”. They
would have older update timestamps.</p></li>

<p>Agency ID List management has its own page which can be accessed under
the “Core Component” menu. In Score, there is only one Agency ID List
created by the default account, namely, “oagis”. The current design does
not allow developer users to create a new Agency ID List. The idea is
the agency ID is one of the lowest common denominators in a standard
that facilitate interoperability and having more than one agency ID
Lists does not help. In the future, this restriction will be lifted to
either allow one to be created if none exists or allow many to be
created. Developers however can revise the existing Agency ID List to
add new values and include it in the next release of Core Components. In
Score, Agency ID Lists are considered a kind of CC because they can be
included in the release of standard Core Components.</p>

<section id="overview-of-release-management-process">
<h4>Overview of release management process<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-release-management-process" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A release lifecycle consists of 3 stages including 1) Initialized, 2)
Draft, 3) Published. Only developers can manage releases. Release does
not have an owner; therefore, after a release has been created, any
developer can manage the release. Figure below shows the lifecycle state
transitions.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/image8.png"><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="_images/image8.png" style="width: 5.79247in; height: 1.06265in;" /></a>
<p>There may be multiple releases in the Initialized state. This can help
with release planning. High-level scope of the release can be captured
in the release note.</p>
<p>Only one release draft can be active at any point in time. In other
words, if there is a release draft in the system, another release draft
cannot be created. The release draft allows the standard development
team/community to review the changes to the release and the release
itself as a whole. Once the review period is over, if some changes are
needed the release draft has to be first canceled, and then all changes
to CCs (recall that CCs also include developer code lists and agency
identifier list) assigned to the draft can be updated again. The release
may move back and forth between the Initialized and Draft state until
all comments are satisfactorily addressed. Once that is the case, the
release can be published, and it is moved to the Published state. In the
published state, the release information can no longer be changed.</p>
<p>A release in the Initialized state can be discarded. In such case, the
release is purged from the application and can never be restored back.</p>

click on ellipsis in the last column of the desired initialized
release and select “Create Draft”.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Release Assignment” page is open. The page has two panes left

<li><p>If there is no need to update any release detail, the release can
be published by clicking on the ellipsis in the last column of the
release draft and selecting “Move to Published”. Click “Update” in
the confirmation dialog. It is important to note that release
detail cannot be changed after the release is published.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a need to update some release detail:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="#find-a-release">Open the detail page of the release</a> that
is in the Release Draft state.</p></li>
<li><p>Release detail can be updated in the same way as when <a class="reference external" href="#create-a-release">the
release was first created</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Publish” button.</p></li>
<li><p>Click “Update” in the confirmation dialog.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The “Release” page opens showing that the release is being published
– the State column is shown as Processing. If there are not hundreds
of new or changed CCs, the publish processing can finish in few
seconds. The page is NOT automatically refreshed when the processing
is done. The user has to refresh the page to see whether the
processing is done. When that is the case the State column will
display <em>Published</em>. At this stage, the user may go to the “Core
Component” page and on the <em>Branch</em> filter at the top-left of the
page select the release from the list to see all CCs in the published
release.</p></li>

<h1>Module Management<a class="headerlink" href="#module-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Module Management has three major functions Manage Module-Release
Assignment, Manage CC-Module Assignment, and Manage Module Dependency.
The data associated with these two functions are used for serializing
the developer CCs (including DT, Code Lists, and Agency ID List) into
files. The data can be managed only by developers. End users can access
Module Management related pages and data but they cannot make any
change.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because entities related module management have no ownership.
Multiple developers may edit them at the same time.</p>

<section id="module">
<h3>Module<a class="headerlink" href="#module" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Module is generally a path to a directory or a file. Files are shown
without a file extension such as ‘xsd’ or ‘json’, because they are meant
to be syntax independent.</p>
<p>A module can belong to one and only one module set. Therefore, even
though a module may have the same path, they are different module
entities.</p>
</section>
<section id="module-set">
<h3>Module Set<a class="headerlink" href="#module-set" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Module Set is a collection modules. Typically, at least one module set
is created per a release of CCs although this is not necessary as a new
release may reuse prior module set particularly when there is no new
file. Multiple module sets may be created for a release for different
directory structures or CC assignments are needed, for example, for
different expressions. An expression means a serialization of the CCs
into files. One syntax may have more than one expression. For example,
the OAGIS standard has multiple expressions in XML schema, one using
global-type-global-element pattern, another using
global-type-local-element pattern.</p>
</section>
<section id="module-set-release">
<h3>Module Set Release<a class="headerlink" href="#module-set-release" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Module Set Release associates a module set with a release. It allows a
module set to be reused across releases. This can save time when there
is no new file or changes in the directory structure in a newer release.
The entity also facilitates the CC assignments to (file) modules in the
module set as CC assignments have to be done in a context of a release.</p>

<h1>BIE Management<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="bie-in-brief">
<h2>BIE in brief<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-in-brief" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>BIE (Business Information Entity) is a derivation (extension and
restriction or also known as a <strong>profile</strong>) of a shared CC (Core
Component). CCs are the canonical, context-independent data structure
and semantic definitions. BIEs, on the other hand, are profile of the
CCs for a particular usage context and provide implementation details of
the CCs for that particular context.</p>
<p>There are in fact a few types of BIEs corresponding to the few types of
CCs per the UN/CEFACT Core Component Specification (CCS), also known as
ISO 15000-5. Score has somewhat simplified the BIE and make it more
user-friendlier than what you might experience in the CCS. In this user
guide we will not dive into the nitty-gritty detail of the various types
of BIEs and how they are related to CC counterparts. So, in this user
guide when talking about BIE, it could mean the root node or any of its
descendant nodes in a tree representation of a data structure
definition. The root BIE may be also referred to as <strong>top-level BIE</strong>. A
top-level BIE is created from an ASCCP.</p>
<p>A BIE is always associated with a Business Context, which provides the
metadata about the applicability of the BIE. This is also referred to as
CC’s usage context. To create a BIE, a Business Context is needed. See
<a class="reference external" href="#manage-end-user-agency-id-lists">Manage Context</a> which provides
introductions and guidelines for the management of Business Context and
its dependencies.</p>
<p>A BIE simplifies its corresponding CC in two ways so that the data
structure definition (schema) becomes a simpler tree structure that is
easier for business analyst and software developer to consume. In other
words, CCs are for the data modeler and data architect; and BIEs are for
business analysts and integration developers. You may have seen
modelling constructs in XML Schema, UML or similar, where there are
features, such as Subtyping, Restriction, Abstract, Group. These
constructs support formal semantic representations and the reuse of the
vocabulary and data structure definition. These constructs exist only in
the CC realm and they are removed or flatten in the BIE realm, as BIE is
not about defining a data model but using it.</p>
<p>When the user views or edits the BIE tree, the tree has different font
formats for each tree node. These different formats are not very
important for the user who is primarily interested in the use case
associated with a BIE. The detail pane on the right side of the tree
shows different fields where the user can customize the BIE, when the
node is checked (enabled/used) and is currently selected. The fields are
based primarily on whether the node can have a value in an instance or
not. If so, it is possible to customize the value restriction (i.e.,
value domain). The value restriction can be in the form of a primitive
type, code list, or agency identification list (a code list that is
specifically about identifying an organization). With that, we will
first describe <a class="reference external" href="#bie-content">Manage Code Lists</a> and then <a class="reference external" href="#manage-end-user-agency-id-lists">Manage
Context</a> before <a class="reference external" href="#manage-bie">Manage
BIE</a> where we will provide more details about fields on
the different kinds of BIE nodes.</p>
<p>A note about the names. Names of BIEs (and their corresponding CCs) are
stored and displayed on the UI in a space separated format, which is a
canonical form. This makes them easier to read and also allows for
serializations into differing formats, such as upper or lower camel
cases.</p>
<section id="footnote-about-qualifier">
<h3>Footnote about Qualifier<a class="headerlink" href="#footnote-about-qualifier" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>CCS has the notion of Qualifier, which is addition words that may be
prefixed to parts of CC DEN that results in BIE DENs. In other words,
BIE DENs can be different from those of their CC counterparts according
to CCS. At this time, it is not clear how this concept can be
practically applied in the standard development and usage environment
considered by Score. This is because Score treats CCs as the standard
artifact and BIEs as profiles of CCs that shall still conform with the
standard. Therefore, for interoperability names of BIEs shall be the
same as CCs because names are used in actual information exchanges and
software implementation. For these reasons, the Qualifier concept is not
currently used in Score. However, this may change as practical usage of
concept is more understood in the course of industry adoption of Score
and these CCS concepts.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="bie-content">
<h2>BIE Content<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-content" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While BIEs are mainly created by Score end users, they may also be
created by Score developers. Score considers these entities as BIE
related content (or BIE content for short) – the BIE itself, Context
Category, Context Scheme, Business Context, End User Code List, and End
User Core Component.</p>
<p>As the name implied, End User Code List and End User Core Component are
those created and owned by the end user. There are also Developer Code
List and Developer Core Component – see <a class="reference external" href="#developer-vs-end-user-core-components">Developer Vs. end user core
components</a>. Developer Core
Components (that includes Developer Code Lists) have a different set of
states than End User Core Components and End User Code List (parallel to
the Developer Core Components (DCC), let us also include End User Code
Lists when referring to the End User Core Components (EUCC)). Please
review the <a class="reference external" href="#end-user-cc-states">End user CC states</a> section. Since
BIEs are similar to EUCC in that they are already tied to a specific DCC
release and BIEs and EUCCs are used together in <a class="reference external" href="#extend-a-bie">BIE
Extension</a>, BIEs have a similar set of states as
EUCCs. Details of BIE states and user access right are described in <a class="reference external" href="#bie-states">BIE
States</a>.</p>
<p>Since DCCs are standard CCs, EUCCs can use, i.e., can make up of not
only EUCCs but also DCCs. On the contrary, DCCs cannot use any EUCC.
Similarly, as a BIE may belong to an end user or belong to a developer.
An end user BIE may reuse a developer BIE but not vice versa.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Context Category, Context Scheme, and Business
Context do not have boundary between end user ones and developer ones
(although this may change in the future).</p>

<h2>Manage End User Code Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-end-user-code-lists" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>End users can access code list management to create code lists to be
used for restricting fields in an End User Core Component and BIE. Code
list management has its own page and it can be accessed under the Core
Component menu. <strong>End-user code lists can be managed when a published
release branch is selected in the Branch filter.</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to create a code list. The first way is to base it on
(i.e., derive it from) another developer code list, where both
restrictions and extensions are allowed (an end-user code list cannot be
based on another end-user code list). This is important because if a
Core Component (OAGIS Model) already uses a specific code list, such as
a Language Code, <strong>only a code list which is derived from the specified
code list, in this case, the Language Code, can be used in the BIE
restriction</strong>.</p>
<p>The other way is to create a brand-new code list. Such a code list can
be used in a BIE whose based CC is typed to the generic code type. Most
OAGIS CC fields use the generic code type.</p>

<h3>Create a Code List Based on Another<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-code-list-based-on-another" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function allows a code list to be extended and restricted based on
a published developer code list. Only end users are allowed to create a
code list based on another. Creating such a code list makes the code
list available for value domain restriction in the BIE, when the CC from
which the BIE is derived uses the based code list. For example, if a
“Language Code” CC field has been assigned the “oacl_LanguageCode” code
list, the user can only restrict the “Language Code” BIE to one of the
code lists derived from the “oacl_LanguageCode “code list. See the third
table in <a class="reference external" href="#restrict-a-bie">Restrict a BIE</a>. To create a code list

<p><strong>Amend Vs. Revise</strong>: ‘Revise’ is the term used with developer CCs.
‘Amend’ is the term used with end-user CC. The difference is that there
is a snapshot of every revision of a CC such that its whole hierarchical
structure can be retrieved. That is not the case for an amendment. Even
though there are history records for both cases, history records only
capture changes local to the CC and cannot be used to reconstruct the
hierarchical snapshot of a CC.</p>

<h2>Manage Context<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-context" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A business context is required to create a BIE. Therefore, the user
should understand the context management before the BIE management.</p>
<section id="understanding-context">
<h3>Understanding Context<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-context" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are three main concepts related to context management, namely,
Context Category, Context Scheme and Business Context. The dependency
between these three concepts and the BIE is that in order for a BIE to
be created, a Business Context is needed, but a Business Context
requires a Context Scheme, and a Context Scheme requires a Context
Category. Hence, from the user’s perspective it is easier for him to
understand these concepts if they are described in sequence starting
with Business Context first, then Context Scheme, and finally Context
Category.</p>
<p>The intent of a Business Context is to define the situation in which a
BIE should be used. Therefore, a Business Context must be specified in
order to create a BIE (as a BIE is a usage of a CC in a particular
Business Context. A Business Context is specified by a combination of
Context Scheme values.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Context Scheme values within a Business Context
are provided from one or more Context Schemes, each typically from
different Context Categories. For example, a Context Scheme may be a
standard industry classification scheme; and hence, its Context Category
is Industry Context Category.</p>
<p>A Context Category indicates what a Context Scheme is about. Another
example of Context Category can be Application Context Category or
Business Process Context Category. Similar Context Schemes maintained by
different standard agencies or different versions of the same standard
schemes, may be used in specifying a Business Context. Context Category
provides a way to indicate that these Context Schemes are intending to
specify the same dimension about the Business Context.</p>
<p>It should be noted that for Score, all the values within a Business
Context are always interpreted conjunctively. For example, if the
Business Context consists of [Automotive, Electronics] context values
for the <strong>Industry</strong> context category, [Electronic Component Purchasing]
for the <strong>Business Process</strong>, [Outbound B2B] for the <strong>Integration
Type</strong>, it means that the BIE, to which the Business Context is
assigned, is applicable when the transaction is an Outbound B2B
transaction, within the Electronic Component Purchasing business
process, <strong>AND</strong> Automotive and Electronics industries. The business
context suggests that the BIE should be used in a business process
involving Automotive Manufacturer/Vendor buying parts from an
Electronics Manufacturer/Vendor. If the industry context were to have
only Automotive context value, it would mean the BIE is for transacting
within the Automotive industry.</p>

<p>A BIE can be in WIP, QA or Production state. WIP state means that the

that the BIE is ready to be reviewed or tested. Finally, Production
means that the BIE is already in use in a deployment.</p>
<p>The figure below shows life cycle states of BIEs. When a BIE is created
for the first time, it is placed in the WIP state. Allowed transitions
are from WIP to QA, from QA back to WIP and from QA to Production state.
A BIE can be discarded (i.e., permanently removed from the database)
when it is in WIP state.</p>

<li><p>On the top menu of the page, click “BIE”.</p></li>

<li><p>On the returned “Create BIE – Select Business Contexts” page, choose
one or multiple Business Contexts to associate with the BIE by
clicking the corresponding checkboxes. The logic that is applied
between different Business Contexts is defined by the logical
operator “OR”. That is, a BIE can be meaningful and used in any of
the assigned business contexts. If the desired Business Context does
not exist, the user should exit this page by going to another page,
e.g., <a class="reference external" href="#create-a-business-context">Create a Business Context</a>,
first and restart the whole Create BIE process. The user can also
open another browser tab and create a Business Context, use the
browser refresh button on the previous browser tab and the new
Business Context will show up for selection. The user MAY use another
browser tab to <a class="reference external" href="#search-and-view-business-context-detail">Search and view Business Context
detail</a> to help with the
selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Next” button.</p></li>
<li><p>On the upper middle side of the table on the returned “Create BIE –
Select Top-Level Concept page”, select the release on which you want
to base your BIE in the <em>Branch</em> drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>Select an ASCCP from which the BIE is derived to become the root node
(aka, root element) of the BIE. Developers can select
Published/Developer ASCCPs only while end users can select
Published/Developer ASCCPs or end user ASCCP that are in Production
state. You can find the ASCCP via:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Bottom pagination bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Sorting the results by clicking on a column, such as the “DEN” or
“Updated on” columns. Clicking the column name multiple times will
toggle between the ascending and descending sorting.</p></li>
<li><p>Search function which allows you to find an ASCCP via its Property
Term, Definition and Module. The Module is a physical file that
the ASCCP has been or to be serialized to in that particular
release. When the Module is specified, only ASCCP whose Module
path matches the specified string will be returned. It provides an
additional filter or the user may simply enter a search string in
the Module field and browse for an ASCCP. For example, a user
using OAGIS standard may wish to search only ASCCPs serialized in
the <em>Components.xsd</em>. In such case, the user can simply enter
“Component” in the Module field (despite longer actual module
path). The user should not enter a file extension (because of the
syntax-independent purpose within Score, the file extension is not
kept but depends on what syntax to serialize to). As a second
example, the user may enter “Noun” in the Module field. In this
case, Score will look for an ASCCP that is an OAGIS noun (because
all OAGIS noun files have “Noun” in its module path). See also
<a class="reference external" href="#how-to-search-and-filter-for-a-core-component">How to Search and Filter for a Core
Component</a>

wonder what is and why he/she has to select an ASCCP, ASCCP
corresponds to xsd:element in XML Schema, which is the only construct
that can be instantiated. In an actual integration, a BIE is going to
be instantiated; hence, we need an ASCCP at the root and ASCCP
Property Term is the name of the element.</p>

<h3>Restrict a BIE<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-a-bie" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To restrict a BIE, it has to be in the WIP State. If you are not already
on the page where you can edit a BIE, you need to first <a class="reference external" href="#search-and-retrieve-a-bie">Search and
retrieve a BIE</a>.</p>
<p>The BIE edit page is divided into the two panes: the left one depicting
the BIE tree, namely the <em>Tree</em> pane, and the right one showing the
details of a selected node of the BIE, namely the <em>Details</em> pane.</p>
<p>A BIE tree is a data structure in which different types of BIEs are
organized hierarchically. Each node in the BIE tree has names that are
displayed in a few different font types corresponding to different types
of the BIEs. We will not go into the detail of different BIE types,
because the user should not have to, i.e., Score aim is for BIE to serve
business analysts and they should have minimal concerns about modeling
constructs.</p>
<p>For the BIE editing purpose, what matters is only two different kinds of
nodes, one that is a container of other nodes and cannot directly have a
value and the other that can have a value. The latter is apparent with
the fields on the right, <em>Details</em> pane. It has extra fields to provide
the value restriction (aka, value domain), such as fixed, primitive
type, or code list allowed in the instance. Except for the root node,
before you can customize the fields in its <em>Details</em> pane, the node
<strong>NEED TO be enabled</strong> either by using the checkbox in the BIE tree or
by selecting the node on the BIE tree and checking the <em>Used</em> checkbox
on the top of the <em>Details</em> Pane. Some nodes are enabled by default
because it is a mandatory node.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Toggle the “Hide unused” checkbox at the top-right corner of
the page to hide or display the unused nodes of a BIE.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After the node is already enabled, <strong>BE SURE</strong> to click
on the node in the BIE tree you want to customize its details. The
<em>Details</em> pane display details of the node highlighted in the tree. Just
clicking the checkbox on a node does not bring up the details of the
node on the right-side; it is still showing the details of the last node
selected, <strong>be careful</strong> with that as you might end up editing the
details of the previous node you selected and not the last node you
enabled (Note that this behavior allows the UI to work faster.
Additionally, some users prefer to browse through the tree and
check/enable the nodes he/she wants and return later to edit their
details).</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Notice the breadcrumb on top of the tree. It shows the focus
of the <em>Details</em> pane.</p>
<p>Below, we explain the fields in the detail pane of the few types of
nodes described earlier.</p>
<p><strong>The root node:</strong></p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><em>Name</em>
(Uneditable)</p></td>
<td><p>The name of the root data element (e.g., BOD,
Noun, Common Components) that is displayed at the
top of the detail pane. This is the same as its
corresponding CC and is not editable.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Release</em></p></td>
<td><p>The release of the core component (e.g., 10.6)
that the root node is derived from.</p></td>

<td><p>The user that currently owns the BIE.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><em>Business
Context</em>
(Mandatory)</p></td>
<td><p>At least one Business Context must be assigned to
a BIE. Multiple different business contexts can
be also assigned to a BIE. These business
contexts are joined by the logical connective OR
so that it means the BIE can be used in multiple
contexts. Add business context by start typing
the business context name. A list of matching
business context will show up for selection.
Remove a business context by clicking on the X
mark next to the business context. There is no
need to click the “Update” button.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Version</em>
(Optional)</p></td>
<td><p>Version number you want to assign to the root
BIE. It can be in any format your organization
chooses.</p>
<p>When the <em>Version</em> is set and there is a “Version
Identifier” direct child in the root BIE, the
<em>Fixed Value Constraint</em> is automatically
assigned to the “Version Identifier” node. The
Fixed Value Constraint of the “Version
Identifier” node is also set to be the same with
the Version field, but it can be still changed.
The value of the Version field of the root node
drives the Fixed Value Constraint of the “Version
Identifier” node but not the opposite.</p>
</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><em>Status</em>
(Optional)</p></td>
<td><p>This is a free text field typically used for the
detail BIE development status in addition to the
built-in statuses described in the <a class="reference external" href="#bie-review-process">BIE Review
Process</a>. For example,
while the BIE is in the WIP or QA state, an
organization may wish to capture detailed
statuses, such as Data Architect Review, Data
Architect Approve, Development and Testing,
Development Review, and Testing Completed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Business Term</em>
(Optional)</p></td>
<td><p>Other names of the data element commonly known in
the context. For example, the user may wish to
capture a BOM BIE that is commonly known as Super
BOM, Engineering BOM, etc. in its context. At
present the application support only one Business
Term field; however, the user may use a
semi-colon to separate multiple Business Terms.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><em>Remark</em>
(Optional)</p></td>
<td><p>Remark is a free-form text field that can be used
to capture comments that are not a part of the
semantic definition, such a reminder/note the BIE
editor would like to make. For example, the user
may wish to take a note “Need to discuss this
with Scott.”</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Context
Definition</em>
(Optional but
highly
recommended)</p></td>
<td><p>This field captures the context-specific semantic
definition of the BIE in natural language. It may
describe in detail how or in what situation the
BIE should or should not be used. For example,

Component Definition additional explanation when
the corresponding <strong>reusable</strong> component is used
within the parent BIE node. Similarly, the
Component Definition adds to the Type Definition
when the corresponding <strong>reusable</strong> type is used
to define the component. For example, a type can
be an Address Type; and a component can be a
Home Address or another component Work Address,
both of which uses the reusable Address Type.
Both Home Address and Work Address component
should have their own Component Definitions, one
saying “It is the residential address” and the
other saying “It is the address where businesses
are conducted.” Both Home Address and Work
Address components may be associated (used) with
an Employee type resulting in two associations,
which have corresponding two Association
Definitions. The Association Definition of the
Home Address may say “An employee may have
multiple home addresses, one of which must be
designated as primary.” Therefore, a user may
wish to see all three definitions of the CCs,
from which the Home Address BIE (under the
Employee BIE) is derived including the
Association Definition (in the previous
sentence), the Component Definition (definition
of the Home Address component itself), and Type
Definition (from the Address type).</p>
<p>One can imagine that the Home Address component
may also be associated with a Contact type,
where a different Association Definition of the
Home Address may be specified.</p>

<p>In summary, a BIE is edited by enabling a BIE node in the BIE tree to be
used and then changing its details. To do so:</p>

“Enable Children” option to enable all the children of this node in
one shot (i.e., to enable their “Used” checkbox). The user can also
click “Set Children Max Cardinality to 1” option to set the Max

</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Scroll down detail pane on the right side and find the field you want

<li><p>Enter a new value in the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Click “Update” when finish.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “Round Arrow” icon located at the top right of the

</ol>
<p>Note that you have to click “Update” in order for the BIE to be updated
and for the changes to be saved. Each time you click “Update” a
confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page informing you
that the BIE has successfully updated. Although it is not necessary to
click “Update” for every change to the BIE node, it is recommended that
the user click the “Update” button frequently. If the server response is
slow either due to network tardiness or server loads, the user might
want to click the “Update” button less frequently.</p>
<p>Note that while end users can create and restrict a BIE which is derived
from an end user ASCCP that is in Production state, its editability may
change over time. This is because the ASCCP or any of its descendant CCs
may be amended while the BIE is being edited. In other words, end user
CCs may change to WIP, QA or Deleted state anytime. The BIE nodes, whose
underlying CC is an end user CC not in Production state, will not be
editable. These BIE nodes, including their children, are shown in the
BIE tree, but they are not editable. They become editable when the
underlying CC is moved in the Production state again (the BIE page has
to be refreshed or reopened). In case that a CC node is Deprecated, the
corresponding BIE node can be still edited, but it is flagged in grey
color.</p>

<h3>Extend a BIE<a class="headerlink" href="#extend-a-bie" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<section id="bie-extension-fundamentals">
<h4>BIE extension fundamentals<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-extension-fundamentals" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Extension is generally an OAGIS architectural concept. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/codesfortrade/CCTS/CCTS-Version3.pdf">UN/CEFACT
Core Component Specification
(CCS)</a>
has no provision for extension. Almost all OAGIS complex components
(i.e., OAGIS <a class="reference external" href="#aggregate-core-component-acc">ACC</a>) have their own
extension points. It is a practical design that allow standard users to
add content specific or proprietary to the organization adopting the
standard. For example, extension may be appropriate for adding specific
fields needed in reference components such as Purchase Order Reference
(possibly because the organization found that another call back to
retrieve specific information about the purchase order to achieve its
integration objective does not meet its performance criterion).</p>
<p>While in Score, an extension is invoked on a BIE node, the content is
added to the CC. Consequently, the added content shows up on current and
future BIEs that are based on the same CC. For example, if end user A
had invoked BIE Extension on and added content to the Extension node of
the Purchase Order Line BIE that is based on the Purchase Order Line CC
in Release 10.6, and another Purchase Order Line BIE created later on by
end user B on the same release will also see the content added by end
user A.</p>
<p>When the user invokes a BIE extension function, a few types of Core
Components (CCs) are created behind the scene including a User Extension
Group ASCC, a User Extension Group ASCCP and a User Extension Group ACC
(UEGACC). These CCs are hidden in the CC view, except the UEGACC.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ASCC and the ASCCP is only to allow the UEGACC to be
added to the Extension component, as illustrated below. In this
illustration, the Application Area Extension ACC is the Extension
component of the Application Area ACC (the Application Area ACC is not
included in the illustration).</p>
<p>The reason Score creates the Application Area User Extension Group ACC
is so that revisions can be made to the extension without revising the
(standard) Application Area Extension ACC. When the user edits the
extension, i.e., adding/removing the data elements via BCCs or ASCCs,
he/she is actually editing the UEGACC. DEN pattern of the UEGACC is the
concatenation of the [Name of the BIE node parent to the extension node]
and the string “User Extension Group. Details”. The user may open UEGACC
in the Core Component to make edits. See <a class="reference external" href="#life-cycle-dependency-between-eucc-and-bie-extension">End User Core Component
Management</a>.

<p>It should be noted that BIEs corresponding to these CCs are hidden from
the user in the BIE view. Data elements added to the UEGACC will appear
as if they were direct children of the Application Area Extension BIE.</p>
</section>
<section id="basic-bie-extension">
<h4>Basic BIE extension<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-bie-extension" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>This section provides a guide to extend a BIE, when it is not being
extended by another user or it has never been extended within the CC
release the BIE bases on. See <a class="reference external" href="#advanced-bie-extension">Advanced BIE
extension</a> for guides about these other
situations.</p>
<p>BIE extension is accessible only by end users. Developers can neither
extend a BIE nor use the associations of the extensions created by end
users when they restrict a BIE. Developers can only view BIE extensions
in the Core Component list page (see <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-search-and-filter-for-a-core-component">How to Search and Filter for a
Core Component</a>). In
order for a BIE to be extended, it has to be in WIP State. In addition,
a BIE node can be extended only if it has an Extension child node. A BIE
node has an Extension child if its corresponding CC has the Extension
child component (as designed by the standard architect).</p>
<p>To start, if the top-level BIE you would like to extend is not already
opened, see <a class="reference external" href="#search-and-retrieve-a-bie">Search and retrieve a BIE</a>
to open it.</p>
<p>On the page where you can edit a BIE<em>,</em> expand the BIE tree until you
see the desire Extension point (a node with the name Extension) of a BIE
node you would like to extend. Click on the ellipsis icon located next
to the Extension component as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/image11.png"><img alt="Graphical user interface, application, Teams Description automatically generated" src="_images/image11.png" style="width: 4.235in; height: 3.895in;" /></a>
<p>The context menu appears showing two options related to BIE Extension –
“Creating ABIE Extension Globally” and “Create BIE Extension Locally”.
Once you have chosen to create an extension, you can append (i.e.,
create an association to) an ASCCP or a BCCP to the extension.
<strong>Important</strong>: Click Update to save BIE before invoking extension as
unsaved BIE data will be loss.</p>
<p>A global BIE extension means that the added BCCP will appear globally in
all BIE’s extensions. The user cannot add an ASCCP to a global BIE
extension since it will create a cyclical structure (this is because
most ASCCP also contains the global extension). Compared to a global BIE
extension,, a local BIE extension exists only in the component you have
selected to extend (for example, in the above illustration added data
elements will be specific to the Allocate Resources component).</p>
<p>Global extension is a design/feature of the OAGIS standard. Making such
extension is generally very rare as any added data element will appear
in all Extension components. One example situation could be when an
entire enterprise architecture decided that all (extensible) data
component should have a UUID.</p>
<p>To create an extension:</p>
<p>After either “Create ABIE Extension Locally” or “Create ABIE Extension
Globally” context menu item is invoked, Score displays the corresponding
UEGACC (see the <a class="reference external" href="#bie-extension-fundamentals">BIE extension
fundamentals</a> section). This is actually
a Core Component editing view. Without going into details of this view,
the user can keep expanding the tree to see generic data elements
already exist in any extension component. These are non-semantic
extension data elements. However, the user can add semantic data element
to the UEGACC, see <a class="reference external" href="#add-a-property-to-an-acc">Add a property to an
ACC</a>. The user may also want to construct
additional End User Core Component (EUCC) and use them in the UEACC. See
<a class="reference external" href="#life-cycle-dependency-between-eucc-and-bie-extension">End User Core Component
Management</a>.</p>
<p>After additional data elements have been added to the UEGACC, they
cannot be used or edited in the BIE while the UEGACC is still in the WIP
state. Indeed, the UEGACC can be in three states as described below.
Only when it is in the Production state, then its content can be used in
BIEs:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>WIP state that allows for appending and removing data elements
(ASCCPs or BCCPs). In this state, no other user can invoke the
extension on the BIE with the same underlying Core Component. Other
users can however view the current content of the UEGACC by open it
from the “View/Edit Core Component” under the “Core Component” menu.
Current content of the UEGACC also shows up in corresponding BIE
extensions; however, the content cannot used or edited in the BIE.</p></li>
<li><p>QA state that allows other users to review and provide their comments
(see <a class="reference external" href="#commenting">Commenting</a>). In this state, the UEGACC cannot
be changed. However, the current owner of the CC can transition the
state back to WIP for further editing or to Production state. Similar
as in the WIP state, no other user can invoke BIE extension that uses
the same UEACC; and the content of the UEGACC can be viewed by other
users in the Core Component view and also in the corresponding BIE
extensions but it can not be used or edited in the BIE.</p></li>
<li><p>Production state. In this state, the revision is permanently made to
the UEGACC, it is like a commit in a version control. The
significance of this state to the BIE development is that the content
of the UEGACC can be used in corresponding BIE extensions. Note
however that if the UEACC uses any EUCC and if the EUCC is not the
Production state, the BIE node corresponding to the EUCC still cannot
be viewed, used, or edited (see <a class="reference external" href="#life-cycle-dependency-between-eucc-and-bie-extension">Life-cycle dependency between EUCC
and BIE
extension</a>).
Also, in this state, the BIE Extension can be invoked again on the
BIE node that relies on the UEGACC. This would result in increasing
in the revision number of the UEGACC and only backwardly compatible
changes can be made (see also <a class="reference external" href="#advanced-bie-extension">Advanced BIE
extension</a>). See <a class="reference external" href="#bie-states">BIE
States</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#bie-review-process">BIE Review
Process</a> for additional information about BIE
states.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to open the UEGACC page again (if you have left the
page). First, open by invoking BIE Extension on the same extension node
in the BIE as described in <a class="reference external" href="#bie-extension-fundamentals">Basic BIE
extension</a>. This option is available
only to the current owner of the UEGACC. The other way is by the Core
Component page. In this case, the user clicks the “View/Edit Core
Component” menu item under the “Core Component” menu (see <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-search-and-filter-for-a-core-component">How to Search
and Filter for a Core
Component</a> and see
<a class="reference external" href="#bie-extension-fundamentals">BIE extension fundamental</a> for the
UEGACC DEN pattern). This option is available to both the current owner
and other users.</p>

<section id="advanced-bie-extension">
<h4>Advanced BIE extension<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-bie-extension" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Case 1: The UEGACC is being edited by another user, i.e., it is in WIP.</p>
<p>The user encounters this situation when he/she tries to extend a BIE
node, which uses the same Extension core component (or strictly speaking
the UEGACC, see <a class="reference external" href="#advanced-bie-extension">BIE extension
fundamentals</a>) as another BIE node also
being extended. For example, while user A is extending the Application
Area node within an Acknowledge BOM BIE, the respective Application Area
UEGACC is being Edited. If user B invokes the extension on the
Application Area node within a Show Shipment BIE, user B will receive a
message indicating that extension to the Application Area is being made
by another user and that user B cannot perform an extension to the BIE
at this time.</p>
<p>Case 2: Similar to case 1, but the Extension core component is in QA
state.</p>
<p>With respect to the example given in Case 1, user B will receive a
message indicating that the extension to the Application Area is being
made by another user and asking whether he/she would like to review the
extension. If the user answers yes, then the UEGACC is displayed. The
user B can provide comments about what changes he/she might want to the
extension (see <a class="reference external" href="#commenting">Commenting</a>).</p>
<p>Case 3: The BIE has been extended before.</p>
<p>This case means that there is already a revision of associated UEGACC in
the Production state (i.e., a revision of UEGACC) before the current BIE
Extension invocation. In this case, Score will open the UEGACC for
amendment. The user can update the UEGACC as described in <a class="reference external" href="#amend-an-acc">Amend an
ACC</a> – except setting/removing a based ACC. To
continue the example made in Case 1, in this case, user A has already
moved the Application Area UEGACC to the Production state. If user B
then invokes the extension on the Application Area BIE, this will result
in the amendment of the Application Area UEGACC where its revision
number will increment by 1. For the amendment, only backwardly
compatible changes can be made. For example, User B cannot remove any
associations added earlier by user A. He can only edit existing
associations such as deprecating them. He can, of course, add additional
associations. It should be noted that, alternative to invoking the BIE
Extension on the same component, the user can also

that UEGACC is also a kind of EUCC) can change independently, e.g., some
may be in WIP, some in QA, and some in Production, and those in
Production may also be amended at any time by any end user causing it to
go back to WIP. Score ensures the consistency between the BIE contents
derived from these EUCCs while they are still changing by two
mechanisms; 1) blocking BIE from modification while the corresponding
EUCC is not in the Production state and 2) only allowed backwardly
compatible changes to the EUCC if the EUCC has revision number 2 or
more.</p>
<p>Because of the first mechanism, BIE nodes corresponding to EUCCs that
are not in the Production state are either blocked from expanding or
from making any changes in the BIE tree. For example, if an UEGACC owned
by user A uses an EUCC that is in WIP and is owned by user B, User A
will not be able to profile the EUCC in UEGACC until user B moves the
EUCC into the Production state. And if another user C happens to amend
the EUCC while user A is profiling the extension, user A will be
profiling based on the pre-amendment version until user refresh the BIE
page. If after refreshing the BIE page, the EUCC is still in WIP or QA,
user A will not be able to make further profiling until the EUCC is
moved into the Production state again.</p>

<h3>BIE Review Process<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-review-process" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>BIE review process supports the collaborative aspect of the BIE
development. This is enabled by three BIE development states, namely
WIP, QA and Production. They may be used in the following fashion.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A BIE developer creates a BIE and keeps it in the WIP state. He is
the BIE <strong>owner</strong> and he is the only one having access to edit the
BIE in this state. Other users cannot view the BIE details nor edit
it in the WIP state. Other users can only see that the BIE exists and
is in the WIP state.</p></li>
<li><p>When he is done with the BIE development, he transitions it to the QA
state. In this state, other users, such as other subject matter
experts, developers, data or enterprise architect can access, review,
and provide offline comments for the BIE.</p></li>
<li><p>For the BIE developer to make changes after receiving comments,
he/she takes the BIE back to the WIP state. To change a BIE’s state
from QA to WIP, the BIE developer has to retrieve the BIE (see
<a class="reference external" href="#search-and-retrieve-a-bie">Search and retrieve a BIE</a> ) and then
click “Back to WIP” at the top-right of <em>Edit BIE</em> page. Steps 2 and
3 can be revisited to complete the BIE review cycles. In addition to
the BIE state, the <em>Status</em> field in the root BIE node may be used
for capturing detailed BIE development states, as it is a free text
field. For example, the BIE developer may set the status field to
‘Architecture Review’ in the first few cycles of shuttling between
the WIP and QA state. Then, he/she may set the status field to
‘Implementation Test’, the next time he put the BIE to the QA state
and then ‘Final Review/Approval’.</p></li>
<li><p>Once there are no more comments, the BIE developer himself may move
the BIE to the Production state. To do so, BIE developer retrieves
the BIE (see <a class="reference external" href="#search-and-retrieve-a-bie">Search and retrieve a
BIE</a>) that is already in the QA state
and clicks “Move to Production”. Alternatively, an organization may
designate a user, such as an enterprise architect to be the solely
responsible user for the BIE life-cycle management. In such a case,
the BIE developer would <a class="reference external" href="#transfer-bie-ownership-making-bie-editable-by-another-user">Transfer BIE Ownership (Making BIE editable
by another
user)</a>
to the enterprise architect first who makes a final decision whether
he wants to move the state of the BIE to the Production state. The
BIE developer or the enterprise architect may use the status field to
indicate a detailed state such as Production. They may also use the
version field in the root BIE to communicate the BIE revision, e.g.,
“OAGIS_10.4_BIE_1.0.0”. Once the BIE is in the Production state, it
can no longer be changed or discarded. To make a new revision of the
BIE, see <a class="reference external" href="#copy-a-bie">Copy a BIE</a>.</p></li>

<section id="bie-reuse">
<h3>BIE reuse<a class="headerlink" href="#bie-reuse" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>BIE reuse allows for a top-level BIE to be reused (called reused BIE)
under another top-level BIE (called reusing BIE). The reused BIE can be
in any state and owned by any user. However, in order for a reusing BIE
to be moved in the Production state, all its reused BIE nodes should be
in Production state. It should also be noted that normally, a user who
is not the owner of a BIE cannot view its details or express it while it
is in WIP state. Score skips this constraint in case of a reused BIE.
That is, a user can view the detail and express a reusing BIE that
reuses some BIEs in WIP state and owned by a different user.</p>
<p>A target node is a BIE node that the user would like to assign a reuse.
The target-node must be an aggregate node (i.e., the node with bold-blue
font). An aggregate node is an Association Business Information Entity
(ASBIE). An ASBIE represents a complex business characteristic and it is
derived from an Association Core Component (ASCC) in a specific business
context. Similar to an ASCC, it consists of the Associating ABIE based
on an ASCC, the ASBIE Property (ASBIEP) based on an ASCCP and so it can
be reusable (see also <a class="reference external" href="#make-a-bie-reusable">Make a BIE reusable</a>).</p>
<p><em>Developer can reuse a BIE owned by another developer only, while end
user BIE can reuse a BIE owned either by a developer or an end user. Developer BIEs won’t show up for reuse selection when BIE being edited is an end user BIE.</em></p>
<p>To reuse a BIE under another top-level BIE:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Expand the BIE tree</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the ellipsis located next to a target aggregate node – the
target node.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “Reuse BIE” option.</p></li>
<li><p>In the pop-up dialog, all BIEs that can be used on the target node
are displayed for selection (only production top-level BIEs that
reference the same ASCCP as the target node are allowed). To narrow
down the results, you can filter the BIEs based on the <em>Owner</em>,
<em>Updater</em>, the <em>Updated start date</em> and <em>Updated end date</em> (see also
<a class="reference external" href="#how-to-use-search-filters">How to use Search Filters</a>) or the
<em>Business Context</em> search field (see also <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-use-the-search-field-in-general">How to use the Search
field in general</a>). Note
that clicking on the BIE will open up its detail in another browser
tab where you can inspect every detail of the BIE.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a BIE by clicking its corresponding checkbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Select” button.</p></li>
<li><p>On the confirmation dialog returned, confirm that you are okay that
the details of descendant nodes of the target BIE node will be lost.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the target node is replaced by the selected BIE - a
recycling icon indicating it is a BIE reuse node. You can view the
details of the corresponding top-level reused BIE in another tab by
clicking on this icon.</p>
<p>The details of the reused BIE and its descendants cannot be changed.
However, on the detail pane of a reused BIE node, you can change the

<h3>Make a BIE reusable<a class="headerlink" href="#make-a-bie-reusable" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function offers the ability to make an aggregate BIE node (the node
with the bold-blue font) within a (source) top-level BIE reusable. That
is, to create a top-level BIE from a descendant node of a source
top-level BIE. The source top-level BIE can be in any state if it is
owned by the current user. If it is owned by another user, it must be in
the QA or Production state. The interested node may contain a <a class="reference external" href="#bie-reuse">reuse

those BIEs.</p>
<p>To make a BIE reusable:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<li><p>Click on the “Make BIE Reusable” option.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Create” button in the returned confirmation dialog</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point the BIE list page is returned where you can see the new
BIE listed. Until this BIE is successfully created, it is in the
Initiating state; a state that indicates that the BIE is being created.
Once the creation process is finished, the BIE goes to the WIP state
(refresh the page or click “Search” button to see if the creation is
done). This BIE inherits the Business Contexts and release association
of its source top-level BIE. At this stage, the user can still make
changes to the BIE. Until the BIE has been moved to the Production
state, it is not reusable.</p>

<h3>Uplift a BIE<a class="headerlink" href="#uplift-a-bie" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>BIE uplift allows for transferring BIEs that are based on a previous
standard CC release to a newer release. In the BIE uplifting process,
the BIE based on the older CC release is called the <em>source BIE</em> while
the resulting BIE is called the <em>uplifted BIE</em>. The CC release, to which
the source BIE is uplifted to is called the <em>target release</em>.
Correspondingly, the CC release associated with the source BIE is called
the <em>source release</em>. There is no change applied to the source BIE in
the uplifting process.</p>
<p>The BIE uplifting process aims to assist the user in transferring
information of the source BIE to the uplifted BIE taking into account
the changes in CCs between the target and the source releases. Business
contexts associated with the source BIE are also transferred to the
target BIE automatically.</p>
<p>BIEs in QA or Production state can be uplifted by anyone while BIEs in
WIP state can be uplifted by their owners only. Whoever uplifts the BIE
becomes the owner of the uplifted BIE. Therefore, multiple users can
uplift the same BIE to different newer releases.</p>
<p>Score requires limited user involvement for uplifting a BIE. When a BIE
is being uplifted, the information of the enabled nodes of the source
BIE is transferred to the uplifted BIE. That is, the uplifted BIE
contains the information of the enabled nodes along with their details.
To this purpose, Score creates the uplifted BIE based on the top-level
ASCCP of the source BIE. Afterward, Score matches the nodes of the
source BIE to the nodes of the uplifted BIE and transfer their details.</p>
<p>The current version of Score performs that matching based on the GUID of
the CCs that the nodes of the BIE derived from. If a CC has been changed
during a release, Score presents the corresponding BIE node as unmatched
and requires user to manually perform this matching. Matching is allowed
only between nodes of the same type, i.e., ASBIE/ASBIEP/ABIE node with
ASBIE/ASBIEP/ABIE node, BBIE node with BBIE node, and BBIE_SC node with
BBIE_SC node. The user can also skip the manual matching procedure and
leave some nodes unmatched. In that case, the uplifted BIE does not
include any information about the unmatched nodes.</p>
<p>In case that the source BIE contains a node that reuses a BIE, matching
is performed at the same way as described above. However, the user has
to select the BIE to be reused in the uplifted BIE. This BIE should
belong to the same release as the uplifted BIE. Therefore, it is
recommended that the BIE which is reused under the source BIE should be
uplifted before uplifting the source BIE. The user can also create a
completely new BIE in the newer release and reuse it under the uplifted
BIE (see also <a class="reference external" href="#bie-reuse">BIE reuse</a>).</p>
<p>To uplift a BIE:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Select “Uplift BIE” in the “BIE” menu at the top of the page.</p></li>
<li><p>On the returned “Uplift BIE – Select BIE” page:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Select a source release in the <em>Source branch</em> dropdown. The
latest release should not be selected. The BIEs belonging to the
latest release cannot be uplifted.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the target release in the <em>Target branch</em> dropdown. The
uplifted BIE will be associated with this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a source BIE from the listing table below. The list
contains only BIEs in the source release selected in the first
step. Use the pagination at the bottom or use the <em>Property Term</em>,
<em>Business Context</em>, or other filters on the page to find the
desired source BIE (see <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-use-the-search-field-in-general">How to use the Search field in
general</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#how-to-use-search-filters">How to
use Search Filters</a> for help with
these filters). Optionally, click on the name of the BIE in the
<em>Property Term</em> column to see details of the BIE.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Click the “Next” button.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Uplift BIE – Verification” page is returned displaying the
source BIE tree on the left-side and the target BIE tree on the
right-side. The target BIE represents how the source BIE will become
the uplifted BIE. The source BIE tree shows only used nodes, while
the target BIE tree shows all possible, use and unused, nodes. Score
automatically maps used nodes in the source BIE tree with nodes in
the target BIE that share exactly the same underlying CCs based on CC
GUIDs. Automatically mapped nodes in the source BIE are displayed
without a checkbox. The user can click on the source BIE tree node to
see how it is mapped in the target BIE tree. The following tasks are
optional.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Manually map* the unmapped node in the source BIE tree to a node
in the target BIE. There can be unmapped nodes in source BIE due
to some changes in the CCs or extensions made in the source BIE.
This step is optional, i.e., the user can choose to not carry
those nodes to the new version. To map a node, click a node with a
checkbox in the source BIE tree, then click the checkbox of a
desired node in the target BIE*. The system then checks both
checkboxes to indicate that the map has been performed. The user
can review the map again by clicking on the source BIE node. The
system will highlight the mapped node in the target BIE tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a BIE for a BIE reuse node. If the source BIE has a BIE
reuse node, which is marked with a recycling icon, and it has
already been mapped, the system will display an exclamation icon
next to the target BIE node. The user can select a BIE in the
target release to make the target BIE node a BIE reuse node as
well. To do so, make sure that a BIE reuse node is selected on the
source BIE tree, the system will bring the mapped target BIE node
into the focus. Click on the exclamation icon. The system will
bring up a dialog that list compatible top-level BIEs to choose
from. Search and select the desired BIE. See <a class="reference external" href="#bie-reuse">BIE
reuse</a> for more information about BIE reuse. If the
desired BIE is not present, the user may have to uplift the BIE
first or create a new one. This step is optional. If no BIE is
selected for the target node, the uplifted BIE node will contain
only the association information if it was mapped in the target
BIE.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Click the “Next” button.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In this page (i.e., BIE Uplifting Report), the user can view or
download the uplifting report. The report presents the details
about mapped and unmapped node as well as reuse information. In
addition, the report indicates some BIE nodes may use a developer
code list or end-user code list that needs to be manually input
again when the uplifted BIE is open**. The user can use the check
box on the top to hide or view the issues of the BIE uplifting
process that need more attention and manual work. Click the
“Download” button on the report page to download a comma-separated
file of the report. Click “Cancel” to go back to the previous
page. The report table consists of:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The <em>Type</em> column that presents the type of the node of the
source BIE, e.g., BCCP, ASCCP.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Source path</em> column presents the path of the node of the
source BIE and the <em>Target path</em> column presenting the path of
the matched node in the target BIE. Blank target path means the
source node was not mapped. The name of these columns is in the
form of <em>Source/Target “Release of the BIE” path</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Context Definition</em> column presents the <em>Context
Definition</em> field of the BIE node.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Matched</em> column conveys how the nodes have been mapped.
The values can be “System” – mapped by Score, or “Manual” –
mapped by the user. Empty value in this column indicates that
no map was performed for the <em>Source path</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Reused</em> column has three possible values including blank,
“Selected”, “Not Selected”. Blank means the source path is not
a BIE reuse node. “Selected” or “Not Selected” means the source
path is a BIE reuse node. However, “Not Selected” means that
the user did not assign a BIE to the mapped node in the target
BIE indicated in the target path.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Issue</em> column presents details about a specific issue.
User should take care of the issue manually when editing the
uplifted BIE.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Click “Uplift” to create and open the new uplifted BIE. At this stage
the user can make further changes to the BIE as described in
<a class="reference external" href="#restrict-a-bie">Restrict a BIE</a> or to resolve the reported
issues manually.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>*The user’s manual map may have a cardinality and/or domain value
restriction conflict. For example, a cardinal conflict is present when a
source node has 0..n but the target node has 1..n by default based on
the corresponding CC. If this happens, Score copies over the invalid
cardinality. The domain value conflict can occur if the user maps BBIE
(green or italic grey nodes) or BBIE_SC node (red nodes), to one with
incompatible primitives. For example, when the user maps Description to
Creation Date Time. In such a case, Score may not properly copy the
<em>Value Domain Type</em> and <em>Value Domain</em> <em>Restriction</em> details from the
source to the target node. The user should fix these conflicts in the
uplifted BIE. In any case, it is recommended that the user checks the
domain value restriction of all manually mapped nodes in the uplifted
BIE. It is also prudent to express both source BIE and uplifted BIE and
perform a diff to ensure that only expected differences are present as
Score 2.0 is an early version of the BIE uplifting functionality.</p>
<p>**End-user code list assigned to a source BIE node can be carried into
the uplifted BIE only if the end-user code list with the same name, list
ID, and agency ID exists (or has been uplifted) in the target release
and it is allowed by the target BIE node. If this is not the case, an
issue is reported in the uplifting report; and the default primitive
will be assigned to that BIE node instead. The user can use the report
to make necessary adjustments to the uplifted BIE. Therefore, it is
recommended the user should download the report before uplifting BIE.
Developer code lists used in source BIE nodes will be matched based on
the internal ID and carried forward if it is allowed in the target node.
If it is not allowed in the target node, an issue is reported in the
uplifting report and the default primitive will be used in the uplifted
BIE. For example, if the user/system maps a source node with System
Environment Code to a target node with Action code, the issue will be
reported because the two codes are not compatible. The same logic
applies to the agency ID list.</p>

<h3>How to use the Search field in general<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-the-search-field-in-general" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>On many pages where entities need to be selected, to find the entity you
need, type the search term into a Search field, such as the <em>Name</em>,
<em>Description</em>, <em>Property Term</em>, <em>DEN</em>, <em>Business Context</em> fields and
then click the “Search” button. This will list entities whose respective

<p>Multiple words entered into the text search field are treated as AND.
The system will return entities that contain both of these words in any
order. However, there is an option to search for words that must appear
together in the same order using double quotes. For example, enter
[“Process Inventory”] in the DEN search field will return entities whose
DEN contains those two words in that order.</p>
<p>In future Score release an autocomplete drop-down list with suggested
